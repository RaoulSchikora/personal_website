                        <h1>MATH ENTHUSIASTIC COMPUTER SCIENTIST</h1>
                        <p>
                            I am a computer scientist (M.Sc.) with a degree in mathematics
                            (B.Sc.) currently looking for a job as a software developer.
                            Especially, working with an object-oriented language appeals to
                            me, where I am thinking in particular of Java or C++. In Java I
                            already have a good know-how and in combination with C I am
                            confident to be able to quickly improve my basic skills in C++
                            as well. However, I do not limit myself to these two programming
                            languages. On the contrary, as long as the end product convinces
                            me, I work with great enthusiasm into new languages and
                            technologies. Software for applications in the areas of
                            mobility, e.g., passenger or freight transport, as well as for
                            medical purposes are of particular interest to me.
