                    <p>I am a computer scientist (M.Sc.) with a degree in mathematics (B.Sc.) currently 
                    looking for a job as a software developer. Especially, working with an object-oriented
                    language appeals to me, where I am thinking in particular of Java or C++. In Java
                    I already have a good know-how and in combination with C I am confident to be able
                    to quickly improve my basic skills in C++ as well. In general, however, I do not 
                    limit myself to these two programming languages. On the contrary, as long as the 
                    end product convinces me, I work with great enthusiasm into new languages and 
                    technologies. Software for applications in the areas of mobility, such as 
                    passenger or freight transport, as well as for medical purposes are of particular 
                    interest to me. </p>
